SQL code explained to import data from the NHS to create table for Tableau
I start by uploading the data, followed by filtering throught the 10 million rows by specific drugs. 
I then join the health practice data and prescriptions together followed by joining 9 consecutive years together for December. 
Lastly i join that table to a table with all county populations in 2011, including county areas (hectares), males to females etc found in the census section on the government website.
